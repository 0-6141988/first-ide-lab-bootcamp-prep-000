# Your First IDE Lab

Now that you've downloaded and installed the Learn IDE, it's time to solve your first lab.

## Objectives

1. Open this Lab in the Learn IDE.
2. Login to the Learn IDE.
3. Navigate Folders with the File Tree.
4. Open a File from the File Tree.
5. Edit a File with the Text Editor.
6. Save a File.
7. Run a Command with the Terminal.
8. Run Your Tests with `learn` from Terminal.
9. Submit this Lab with `learn submit` from Terminal.

## Goal

To edit the file `edit-me.txt` in this lab using the Learn IDE, run the tests with `learn` and submit the lab with `learn submit`. If you feel comfortable with that, go ahead and try it now by clicking the "Open" button. Otherwise, you can watch a video walkthrough below and read a more detailed explanation.

### 1. Opening a Lab with the Learn IDE

Whenever you're on a lab in Learn that requires the Learn IDE, you'll see an "Open Button" on the Lab's header.

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/learn-sample-header.png" style="border: 1px solid #000; display: block" alt="Lab Header">

Go ahead and click on the Open Button on the Lab's header (not the image above, that's just a sample). The Learn IDE you downloaded and installed in the previous lesson should open.

If clicking on the Open Button did not do anything or gave you an error message, there is a good chance you did not download and install the Learn IDE correctly.

### 2. Login to the Learn IDE

After clicking the "Open Button", the Learn IDE should open and prompt you to login.

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/learn-login.png" style="display: block; border: 1px solid #000">
You can login via the Email and Password you used to create your Learn Account or you can use your new GitHub account to Sign In.

Once you login to the Learn IDE, the lab should open and should look something like:

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/learn-ide.png" style="display: block"> <!-- This should be updated to reflect exactly what they'll see once this lab is deployed and should be scaled better to be less than 293kb -->

### 3. Navigate Folders with the File Tree

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/learn-file-tree.png" style="display: block">

The File Tree in the IDE is a way to browse the file and folders in the lab. It works a lot like a file browser on your computer, showing you the top level folder on top, generally the lab name, and then all the files and folders inside the folder.

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/learn-expanded-tree.png" style="display: block">

A folder is represented in the file tree with a Folder icon and a `>` showing that it is currently folded or closed, hiding the files inside it. If you click on the folder you can expand it or open it, revealing the files inside the directory.

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/learn-context-menu.png" style="display: block">

You can "Right Click" in the File Tree and a context menu will appear, giving you options to work within the folders and files of the lab, like creating a New File or New Folder. When creating a new file or new folder via the context menu, it will be created within the directory you right clicked on, so in the image above, the right click occurred within the `spec` directory, so any new file created would appear there.

### 4. Open a File from the File Tree

When you want to actually edit a file, you can click or double click on it in the File Tree. The file will then open in a new tab in the text editor.

**After opening this lab with the "Open" button, use the File Tree and click on the file `edit-me.txt` to open it.**

### 5. Edit a File with the Text Editor

Once you've opened a file, every tab you see is the Text Editor that allows you to edit the contents of the file. This is where we do our programming and write our code. You open the files you want to edit in a tab in the text editor and can write code and save the file. Each tab gets the name of the file you are editing.

**If you've clicked on `edit-me.txt` as described in how to open a file, you should see a tab now with the title `edit-me.txt`. The file is totally empty. Go ahead and write anything in the file, `Hello World!`, your name, anything. To pass this lab all you need to do is not have a blank `edit-me.txt` file.**

### 6. Saving a File

After you edit a file, you must save it. As mentioned above, each file tab will indicate if the file has been changed and not saved by putting a dot on the right corner of the tab. Once you're done editing a file, save it by going to File -> Save in the application menu, pressing âŒ˜+S (Command and S at the same time) on a Mac, or Ctrl+S (Control and S at the same time) on Windows.

Notice how after saving the file, the blue dot disappears on the tab.

### 7. Running a Command with Your Terminal

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/ide-terminal.png" style="display: block">

On the bottom of the IDE is a Terminal. This is your access point to your development environment that the Learn IDE provides. As a programmer, we use the terminal for a lot of tasks including actually running our code and programs and executing commands. You're going to learn a lot about how to use a Terminal, but for now, know that you can type certain commands into it. Let's try one, `ls`. Click into the terminal, then type `ls` and press enter to execute the command.

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/ls-terminal.png" style="display: block">

`ls` stands for list and it will list all the files in the directory, similar to the file tree. After you press enter you will see output from the terminal responding to the command you typed.

Try another one, from your terminal, type `pwd`, which stands for print working directory, which is the current directory the terminal is in.

<img src="http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/learn-co-orientation/pwd-terminal.png" style="display: block">

As you can see, the terminal is in the `first-ide-lab` directory which is the folder that contains this lab.
